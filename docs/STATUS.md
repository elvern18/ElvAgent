# ElvAgent Development Status

Last Updated: 2026-02-15 (Evening)

## Current Phase

Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - Day 1 Complete!

## Completed Phases

None yet (Phase 1 in progress).

## Active Work

✓ Data layer complete (Agent 1)
✓ Database MCP server complete (Agent 1)
✓ Research layer foundation complete (Agent 2)
→ Next: Remaining researchers or Publishing layer

## Agent Status

| Agent | Branch | Current Task | Status |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Agent 1 (Data) | agent-1-data-layer | Data layer complete | ✓ Done |
| Agent 2 (Research) | agent-2-research | ArXiv researcher done | ✓ Done |
| Agent 3 (Publishing) | agent-3-publishing | Not started | Pending |
| Agent 4 (Orchestration) | agent-4-orchestration | Not started | Pending |

## Phase 1 Checklist

### Setup (Day 1)
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md
- [x] Create STATUS.md
- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] Set up git branches
- [x] Create initial tasks
- [x] Create requirements.txt
- [x] Create .env.example

### Foundation (Days 1-7)
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] SQLite database schema created
- [x] Pydantic settings implemented
- [x] Structured logging set up
- [x] Database MCP server working
- [x] First researcher (ArXiv) functional
- [x] Research skill created
- [x] Base classes created (BaseResearcher, BasePublisher)
- [x] State manager with full database operations
- [x] Cost tracking system
- [x] Rate limiter with token bucket
- [x] Retry utilities with exponential backoff
- [x] Content-researcher subagent spec

## Decisions Made

- **2026-02-15:** Using component-based parallelization strategy (4 agents)
- **2026-02-15:** Using task system + STATUS.md for state tracking
- **2026-02-15:** Git branch per agent strategy
- **2026-02-15:** Built comprehensive base classes first to unblock other agents
- **2026-02-15:** Used async/await throughout for better concurrency
- **2026-02-15:** SQLite for state (simple, reliable, no external deps)

## Blockers

None currently.

## Lessons Learned

[Updated at end of each phase]

## Next Steps

1. ✓ ~~Data layer complete~~
2. ✓ ~~Research layer foundation~~
3. → Build database MCP server (Agent 1)
4. → Implement remaining researchers (HuggingFace, Funding, News)
5. → Begin publishing layer (Agent 3)
6. → Build orchestrator (Agent 4)

## Metrics

- **Lines of Code:** ~2,500
- **Files Created:** 23
- **Tests Written:** 16 unit tests (all passing)
- **API Costs (Today):** $0.00 (no API calls yet)
- **Phase Completion:** 55%
