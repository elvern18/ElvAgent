# Session 2026-02-22-1

**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Branch:** main
**Phase:** Source swap — Reddit → VentureBeat
**Progress:** 442/440 tests (Reddit tests removed, VentureBeat tests added)

---

## Session Goal

Replace Reddit as a research source with VentureBeat AI. Reddit was unreliable (user-generated content, no editorial oversight). VentureBeat has an editorial team covering enterprise AI news, funding, and product launches — complements TechCrunch without overlap.

## Changes Made

### Files Created
- `src/research/venturebeat_researcher.py` — New VentureBeat researcher mirroring TechCrunch pattern (RSS-based, same scoring/category logic, source name `"venturebeat"`)

### Files Modified
- `src/main.py` — Swapped RedditResearcher → VentureBeatResearcher in both test mode (max_items=3) and production mode (max_items=5)
- `src/agents/newsletter_agent.py` — Swapped RedditResearcher → VentureBeatResearcher (max_items=5)
- `src/agents/handlers/newsletter_handler.py` — Swapped RedditResearcher → VentureBeatResearcher (max_items=5)
- `tests/unit/test_researchers.py` — Replaced TestRedditResearcher class with TestVentureBeatResearcher (13 tests)
- `scripts/test_multi_source.py` — Swapped Reddit → VentureBeat
- `scripts/test_content_enhancer_real.py` — Swapped Reddit → VentureBeat, updated docstring

### Files Deleted
- `scripts/test_reddit.py` — No longer needed

### Files Kept (intentionally not deleted)
- `src/research/reddit_researcher.py` — Kept for reference, just removed from all instantiation sites

## Key Decisions

### Decision: Mirror TechCrunch pattern exactly
**Context:** VentureBeat and TechCrunch are both RSS-based industry news sources
**Chosen:** Copy TechCrunch's structure (RSS fetch, same scoring keywords, same category detection)
**Rationale:** Same RSS format, similar content type, proven pattern. No need to reinvent.
**Impact:** Minimal risk, easy to maintain both sources together.

### Decision: Keep reddit_researcher.py on disk
**Context:** Could delete the file entirely or keep for reference
**Chosen:** Keep the file, just remove from all 4 instantiation sites
**Rationale:** Zero cost to keep, useful reference if ever needed again
**Impact:** No import errors since it's not referenced anywhere active

## Metrics

- **Lines Added:** +270 (venturebeat_researcher.py + new tests)
- **Lines Deleted:** -388 (Reddit tests, Reddit script, import swaps)
- **Net:** -118 lines
- **Tests:** 440/440 passing (2 fewer — Reddit had 15 tests, VentureBeat has 13)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Run `python src/main.py --mode=test --verbose` to verify VentureBeat items appear in output
2. Telegram smoke test (end-to-end coding task)

### Outstanding Work
- Telegram smoke test (end-to-end)
- Twitter publisher (waiting API approval)
- Discord publisher (needs webhook config)
- Phase E: x402 self-funding compute (deferred)

## Handover Notes

**What's Working:**
- VentureBeat researcher fully implemented and tested
- All 440 tests passing
- 4-source parallel research pattern preserved (ArXiv, HuggingFace, VentureBeat, TechCrunch)

**Known Issues:**
- None introduced by this change

**Critical Context:**
- VentureBeat RSS is public, no API key needed
- Same scoring logic as TechCrunch (major companies +2, large funding +2, launches +2, AI keywords +1, opinion penalty -1)
- reddit_researcher.py still exists on disk but is not imported anywhere active

**Next Session Start:** `Read docs/STATUS.md and docs/logs/2026-02-22-session-1.md, then run Telegram smoke test`
